  - name: Phylogenetic Stands and Terraces
    description: |
      In phylogenomics, evolutionary trees for groups of species are inferred using genetic data from multiple genes. In the presence of missing data, the solution space (tree space) divides into groups of equally optimal solutions, known as Phylogenetic Terraces.
