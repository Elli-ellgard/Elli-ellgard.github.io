  - name: The Nature of rDNA Units in Arabidopsis
    description: |
      This cross-functional collaboration utilizes next-generation sequencing (NGS) data 
      to explore the higher-order organization of nucleolus organizer regions 
      (NOR2 and NOR4) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. By integrating genomic 
      and bioinformatic approaches, the project aims to uncover the nature and dynamics of rDNA units.

  - name: Phylogenetic Stands and Terraces
    description: |
      In phylogenomics, evolutionary trees for groups of species are inferred using genetic data from multiple genes. In the presence of missing data, the solution space (tree space) divides into groups of equally optimal solutions, known as Phylogenetic Terraces.

  - name: Quasi-Symmetry
    description: |
      This project explores a novel perspective on molecular evolution by decoupling the common assumptions of stationarity and reversibility.
       It demonstrates how a test for quasi-symmetry applied to diversity matrices can detect reversible substitution models, even when assumptions like marginal homogeneity are violated.

      - models of sequence evolution
      - marginal symmetry
      - quasi symmetry
